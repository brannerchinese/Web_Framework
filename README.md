## Simple Web Framework

Assignment at https://hackpad.com/Week-1-Make-a-Web-Framework-qJOpEzlYJZY.

 * Part 1: `server_01.py`. Works. 

        python server_01.py 1234

   where 1234 is a port to listen on. If no port is found, the default is 1924.

 * Part 2, questions 1-2: `server02.py`. Works, but can be improved.

   To add new functions, add them below

        ```
#########################
```

   and then add their names to `self.special` in `CustomHandler.do_Get()`.

[end]
